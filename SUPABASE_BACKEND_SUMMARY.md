## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Functions
- `join_group_by_invite_code()` - Secure group joining
- `calculate_prediction_points()` - Scoring algorithm
- `update_match_result()` - Match completion with points calculation
- `refresh_group_leaderboard()` - Leaderboard recalculation

- User presence tracking
- Typing indicators

### Security Policies
- Users can only access groups they're members of
- Admins can manage group content
- Predictions are locked when matches start
- Chat messages have proper user validation
- Leaderboards are read-only for users

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Add your Supabase credentials
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 2. Database Setup
1. Create Supabase project
2. Run `supabase/schema.sql` in SQL Editor
3. Run `supabase/rls-policies.sql` in SQL Editor
4. Run `supabase/functions.sql` in SQL Editor
5. Enable Realtime for all tables

### 3. Authentication Configuration
- Configure email templates in Hebrew
- Set up redirect URLs for mobile app
- Enable desired auth providers

### 4. App Integration
```typescript
// Use authentication
const { user, signIn, signOut } = useAuth()

// Manage groups
const { groups, createGroup, joinGroup } = useGroups()

// Handle matches
const { matches, createMatch, approveMatch } = useGroupMatches(groupId)

// Real-time chat
const { messages, sendMessage } = useGroupChat(groupId)
```

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

### Database Indexes
- Group members by group_id and user_id
- Matches by group_id, status, and date
- Predictions by match_id and user_id
- Chat messages by group_id and timestamp
- Leaderboards by group_id and points

### Caching Strategy
- Client-side caching with React Query
- Real-time updates override cache
- Optimistic UI updates
- Background refresh for stale data

### Mobile Optimizations
- Efficient real-time subscriptions
- Minimal data transfer
- Background sync capabilities
- Offline-first architecture

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- All tables have RLS enabled
- User data isolated by group membership
- Admin actions properly validated
- Sensitive operations require authentication

### API Security
- Rate limiting on endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure handling of user tokens
- Proper error message handling

### Mobile Security
- Secure storage of tokens
- Certificate pinning (recommended)
- Biometric authentication support
- Session management
